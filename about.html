				Founded in 2015, the Cambridge China Development Forum (CCDF) is a student-run voluntary
				organization affiliated to the Chinese Students and Scholars Association in Cambridge (CSSACAM
				http://cssacam.org/about-cssa/). The CCDF’s primary mission is to promote a deeper
				and more comprehensive understanding of China for the public.
				</p>
				<p>
				Events hosted by the Forum revolve around four major themes: Economics, Politics,
				Philosophy and Culture. The CCDF aims to organise top quality forums, conferences and talks
				for students, scholars and the general public in Cambridge. It also provides a platform for
				students, academia and professionals to discuss and exchange (share and discuss) ideas
				regarding China’s development.
